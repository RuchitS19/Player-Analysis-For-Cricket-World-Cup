In this project we collect data from cricbuzz website with the help of few web-scrapping tools , 
that dataset we collect in in json file  form  and not properly , we first clean that in proper way for our understanding and generate new dataset  insights from from that dataset , here we use python(pandas)
we import that dataset in csv files in our system and upload on Power BI software for visualization .
visualization is nessary for understanding data ,it help to understand data in easy way & find new insights from that
